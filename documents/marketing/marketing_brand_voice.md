# BAUTEN Studio — Brand Voice & Messaging

Tone:
- Confident, clear, friendly, not overly formal.
- Short sentences. No buzzwords.

Core promise:
We help companies ship beautiful, usable UI/UX fast.

Do:
- Use active voice: “We deliver…”
- Use numbers when possible (weeks, days, metrics).
- Mention speed + quality + clarity.

Don’t:
- Overpromise (“guaranteed results”).
- Use slang.

Example tagline:
“Design that ships.”
